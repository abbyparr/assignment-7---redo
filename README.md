a) The purpose of the program is to define functions and learn how to navigate through them. 
b) Question 1 takes a dice configuation and a numeric value, while question 2 takes a string. 
c) The expected output of question 1 is the probability of rolling a series of dice, while question 2 should be the permutations of the characters in the string. 
d) User-defined functions
e) My program could be improved by maintaining effectiveness throughout the program. I could have used a more effective layout of my functions, that would be easier for the reader to understand them. 


For question 1, I improved the program by using for loops to figure out the number of combinations. I also designed the layout more efficient to output the correct values.
For question 2, I took out each individual part of the string and printed it in order to get the desired output. This is more efficient and should output the correct values.
